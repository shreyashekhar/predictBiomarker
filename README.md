# predictBiomarker

Pharmacogenomic biomarker identification is a crucial step to determine if a cancer patient can receive precision medicine treatment. The approaches used to identify these biomarkers are inefficient, only targeting one biomarker at a time, and requiring much time for analysis. As the number of expert pathologists who can identify these biomarkers decreases, the need for a fully computational tool which can identify biomarkers based on gene expression grows. This work demonstrates an approach to build this tool using gene expression solely from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The results indicate that this approach is successful in finding predictive genes and machine learning models which can identify specific biomarkers from RNA gene expression. This analysis suggests that RNA-seq will eventually allow replacement of traditional biomarker identification methods.
